# Man in the middle attack

The aim of the project is to demonstrate the infamous man in the middle attack, a type of cyberattack where a malicious actor inserts him/herself into a conversation between two parties, impersonates both parties and gains access to information that the two parties were trying to send to each other. Software such as Kali Linux, Scapy, Wireshark and Python are used in this package to do the same.

Scapy is is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks, written in Python. It is used to forge or decode packets, send them on the wire, capture them, and match requests and replies. Wireshark is also used in our project for packet analysing.

Above all, a python program that performs the following is written:

1. packet sniffing
2. packet injection
3. packet manipulation
4. ARP spoofing
5. OS Fingerprinting (Passive and Active)
6. other passive or active attacks
7. other MiTM attacks
